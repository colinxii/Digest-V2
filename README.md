## 🔧 Utility Functions

The `utils/dateUtils.js` module provides a comprehensive set of date manipulation functions:

### Core Functions
- **`getRelativeTimeString(dateString)`** - Converts dates to human-readable relative time
- **`getPacificTime()`** - Gets current Pacific Time (centralized timezone handling)
- **`formatCardDate(dateInput)`** - Formats dates for card display components

### Advanced Functions
- **`getMortgageRenewingRanges(currentDate)`** - Calculates mortgage renewal date ranges
- **`getWeekDates(currentDate, weeksFromNow)`** - Gets week boundary dates for appointments
- **`filterItemsByDateRange(items, startDate, endDate)`** - Generic date range filtering
- **`calculateAppointmentStats(appointmentData)`** - Efficient statistics calculation

All functions include comprehensive JSDoc documentation and are fully tested.

## 📦 Component System

### Reusable Card Component (`views/card.ejs`)
A flexible, reusable component that handles both mortgage and appointment cards:

```ejs
<%- include('./card', { 
    item: dataObject, 
    type: 'mortgage' | 'appointment',
    formatCardDate: formatCardDate,
    getRelativeTimeString: getRelativeTimeString 
}) %>
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates 90% of duplicate HTML across templates
- Consistent styling and behavior
- Easy maintenance and updates
- Parameterized for different data types

## 🔗 Integration Workflow

This API is part of a larger automated workflow:

1. **Power Automate Flow** queries Dynamics CRM for relevant data
2. **Data Processing** organizes and structures the CRM data
3. **API Call** sends structured data to this service via POST request
4. **HTML Generation** processes data through EJS templates
5. **Email Delivery** Power Automate receives HTML and sends via Outlook

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite with **12/12 tests passing**, covering:

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: All 7 utility functions with edge cases
- **Integration Tests**: Route functionality and error handling
- **API Tests**: Digest generation and data validation
- **Performance Tests**: Template rendering verification

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

### Test Categories
1. **Basic Route Tests** (3 tests)
   - Health check endpoint
   - Welcome message verification
   - Redirect functionality

2. **Date Utility Functions** (7 tests)
   - Relative time string formatting
   - Pacific Time handling
   - Card date formatting
   - Mortgage renewal ranges
   - Week date calculations
   - Date range filtering
   - Appointment statistics

3. **Advisor Digest Routes** (2 tests)

### Manual Testing
To test the digest generation manually:
```bash
# Start the server
npm run dev

# Visit the test endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/advisor-digest/test

# Or open in browser
open http://localhost:3000/advisor-digest/test
```

### Test Data
Sample test data is provided in `test-digest-payload.json` for consistent testing scenarios.

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Digest Types

1. Create new route file in `routes/` directory
2. Create corresponding EJS templates in `views/` directory
3. Leverage existing utility functions from `utils/dateUtils.js`
4. Use the reusable card component (`views/card.ejs`) for consistent styling
5. Register routes in `index.js`
6. Add comprehensive test cases following existing patterns

### Template Development

Templates use EJS syntax and are optimized for email clients:
- **Inline CSS** for maximum compatibility
- **Table-based layouts** for Outlook support
- **Conditional comments** for Outlook-specific styling
- **Reusable components** for consistent design patterns
- **Utility functions** for data processing and formatting

### Architecture Patterns

#### Utility-First Approach
```javascript
// Use centralized utilities for consistent behavior
const digestData = req.body;
digestData.today = getPacificTime();
digestData.formatCardDate = formatCardDate;
digestData.getRelativeTimeString = getRelativeTimeString;
```

#### Component Reusability
```ejs
<!-- Leverage reusable components -->
<%- include('./card', { 
    item: mortgage, 
    type: 'mortgage',
    formatCardDate: formatCardDate,
    getRelativeTimeString: getRelativeTimeString 
}) %>
```

#### Performance Optimization
- Use `reduce()` instead of `forEach()` for calculations
- Centralize expensive operations in utility functions
- Pre-calculate data ranges before template rendering
- Minimize template logic complexity

### Code Quality Standards

- **JSDoc Documentation**: All utility functions must include comprehensive documentation
- **Error Handling**: Implement try-catch blocks with proper error propagation
- **Testing**: Maintain 100% test coverage for new functionality
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep business logic in utilities, presentation in templates
- **Functional Programming**: Prefer immutable operations and pure functions
